# Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention

## Background

> Definition
* A simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equiped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism.

> Reason
* MEGA was proposed to combat the attention mechanism's two common drawbacks:
1. Weak inductive bias
2. Quadratic computational complexity

## EMA Combination
> Why?
* EMA and attention mechanisms each have their own limitations
* Exponential Moving Average (EMA) captures local dependencies that exponentially decay over time
* Combination allows us to leverage their strengths to complement each other
* The combined model enjoys the benefit from strong inductive bias and maintains the capacity to learn complex dependency patterns.


## Multi-dimensional Damped EMA
* Learnable coefficients
* Develop MEGA mechanism by integrating the EMA with a variant of the single-head gated attention

## Experiments



#### Long-Context Sequence Modeling
* MEGA evaluation on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (2021)
* Designed for the purpose of evaluating sequence models under the long-context scenario
* Input sequences range from 1,000 - 16,000 tokens
