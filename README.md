# Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention

## Background

> Definition
* A simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equiped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism.

> Reason
* MEGA was proposed to combat the attention mechanism's two common drawbacks:
1. Weak inductive bias
2. Quadratic computational complexity
